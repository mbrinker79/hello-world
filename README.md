Introdution of myself to the world.

I have gray hair and like classic rock-n-roll.
Hobbies include reading historical people, places and events in Oregon.
One of the places known for its mark in Oregon history as one of significant flooding and damage to the city and many of it's residents is Heppner, Oregon.
